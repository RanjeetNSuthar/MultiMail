# MultiMail

This Application is used to automate the process of generating multiple emails at the same time with greater ease.

The user can generate multiple emails at the same time by just listing down the email id's and attachment file paths for each recipient on the spreadsheet.
The user has the option of attaching or Creating the attachments if not exist while sending the email. 
Multimail App can also be used in email marketing in which the user want to send similar message to different people just by chaning some fields like name,id etc. which it does automatically thus saving time and human resource. 
Let’s say you run a small business that needs to send PDF invoices to your customers once a month. Your billing software generates the PDF invoices, one for each of your 100 customers. Now you need to send the right invoice to the right customer. Until now, you’d have to prepare multiple emails manually composing and sending 100 individual emails, and having to attach the right PDF to each email. But now, you can automate all of this using the MultiMail .


# Modules of the software:
•	Email id,password : A user has to provide his gmail id and password for login which will be encrypted by MIME. <br />
•	Subject           : Here we have a Common subject for all the emails. <br />
•	Body              : Here the users can put the body content for the email which is fetched by Notebpad.(variable fields should be written inside curly braces E.g {name} ). <br /> 
•	Attachments       : In this the user can create new attachments in MS Word or add existing attachment just by providing the respective paths in the spread sheet.  
                      (In case of new attachments user only needs to modify one word file by mentioning variable fields inside curly braces in Italic font and the System will 
                      automatically generate multiple perosonalized attachments in Document folder which is included in the project folder.) <br />
•	Send mail         : By clicking send button the email will be sent. <br />
